## Introduction

For decades, blackjack has been one of the most popular casino games in the world. There aren't too many rules, so it's easy to learn, it uses a standard deck of cards, and you play against the house rather than your fellow gamblers.

## Values

All number cards are worth their face value, and all picture cards are worth 10. Aces are worth either 11 or 1 points, and are always worth wichever value will give you the best possible hand.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is for the combined value of the cards in your hand to be greater than the value of the cards in the dealer's hand without going over 21.

If either the value of your cards goes over 21, you bust, and lose the round. The same rules apply for the dealer.

At first the dealer will deal two cards to each player and themself. Then the player makes the first move.

Your options are limited to two choices, "hit" and "hold". If you "hit", the dealer will deal you another card. You can continue to hit as many times as you like, until you bust. If you "hold", it is the dealers turn to move.

The dealer plays by a specific set of rules, they must hit until the value of their cards reaches 17 or above, after that they must hold.

In this game, victory is achieved by reaching $1000, but if you lose all your money, you lose the game.
